# Spotify Playlist to YouTube Links Converter

## Description

This Python script allows users to convert a Spotify playlist into a list of YouTube video links associated with the playlist's songs. It uses the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify Web API to fetch track information, and the Pytube library to search for corresponding YouTube videos. The script downloads the audio from the YouTube videos and saves them as MP3 files.

## Prerequisites

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Libraries: Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install spotipy pytube requests
   ```

3. YouTube API Key: Replace the placeholder API key in the `search_youtube` function with your own YouTube Data API key. You can get a YouTube API key by creating a project on the Google Developers Console and enabling the YouTube Data API v3.

4. Spotify API Credentials: To use the Spotify Web API, replace `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri` with your own Spotify application credentials. You can create a new application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications

## How to Use

1. Set up API Keys and Credentials: Make sure to replace the placeholder API keys and credentials in the script with your own.

2. Fetch Spotify Playlist Information: Specify the Spotify playlist ID (`playlist_id`) in the script to fetch the playlist's track information.

3. Run the Script: Execute the script, and it will display the names of the songs and their corresponding YouTube video links. The script will also download the audio from the YouTube videos and save them as MP3 files in the current working directory.

4. Export to File (Optional): The script will automatically write the new song links to "songs_links_temp.txt" to maintain a record of the YouTube links associated with the songs.

## Important Notes

- The script uses the `SpotifyOAuth` from Spotipy to authenticate with the Spotify Web API. Make sure to follow the authentication process if you encounter any authentication-related issues.

- The `search_youtube` function uses the YouTube Data API v3 to search for videos related to the Spotify tracks. Make sure you have enabled the YouTube Data API v3 and replaced the placeholder YouTube API key.

- The script may take some time to download the audio from YouTube videos, depending on the number of tracks in the playlist and your internet connection speed.

Feel free to customize and extend this script to fit your needs. For any questions or enhancements, feel free to reach out to the project author.

Happy converting and enjoy your music!
